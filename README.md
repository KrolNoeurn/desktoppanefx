[javaFXMDI](https://github.com/lincolnminto/javaFXMDI) is a JavaFX version of Swing JDesktopPane which can be used as a container for individual "child" similar to JInternalFrames.  You can minimize the child frame, and an icon of it is located on the bottom of the container pane similar to Windows task bar.
